Because cleavable linkers for prodrugs had not been developed for bacterial proteases, we used substrate phage to discover substrates for proteases found in the bacterial periplasm. Rather than focusing on a single protease, we used a periplasmic extract of E. coli to find sequences with the greatest susceptibility to the endogenous mixture of periplasmic proteases. Using a fluorescence assay, candidate sequences were evaluated to identify substrates that release native amine-containing payloads. We next designed conjugates consisting of (1) an N-terminal siderophore to facilitate uptake, (2) a protease-cleavable linker, and (3) an amine-containing antibiotic. Using this strategy, we converted daptomycin-which by itself is active only against Gram-positive bacteria-into an antibiotic capable of targeting Gram-negative Acinetobacter species. We similarly demonstrated siderophore-facilitated delivery of oxazolidinone and macrolide antibiotics into a number of Gram-negative species.

By contrast, there is no general method for the de novo computational design of multicross-linked proteins with predictable and well-defined folds, including ones not found in nature. Here we use Rosetta and Tertiary Motifs (TERMs) to design small proteins that fold around multivalent cross-linkers. The hydrophobic cross-linkers stabilize the fold by macrocyclic restraints, and they also form an integral part of a small apolar core. The designed CovCore proteins were prepared by chemical synthesis, and their structures were determined by solution NMR or X-ray crystallography. These mesosized proteins, lying between conventional proteins and small peptides, are easily accessible either through biosynthetic precursors or chemical synthesis. The unique tertiary structures and ease of synthesis of CovCore proteins indicate that they should provide versatile templates for developing inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title:\"Spontaneous and specific chemical cross-linking in live cells to capture and identify protein interactions\",\r\n        description: \"B.

Obviating an external trigger for reactivity and affording residue specificity, GECX enables the capture of low-affinity protein binding (affibody with Z protein), elusive enzyme-substrate interaction (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D3 with substrate PCNA), and endogenous proteins interacting with thioredoxin in E. coli cells, allowing for mass spectrometric identification of interacting proteins and crosslinking sites.

Molecular dynamics simulations were used to calculate the free energy cost of inverting the side-chain stereochemistry of individual Thr or Ile residues. Guided by the computational results, we used chemical protein synthesis to prepare three ShK polypeptide chain analogues, each containing either an allo-Thr or an allo-Ile residue. The three allo-Thr or allo-Ile-containing ShK polypeptides were able to fold into defined protein products, but with different folding propensities.

This lack of activity was at odds with previously reported results for an ShK diastereomer designated d-allo-ShK, for which significant biological activity had been observed in a similar receptor-blocking assay. As reported, d-allo-ShK was made up of d-amino acids, but with retention of the natural stereochemistry of the chiral side chains of the Ile and Thr residues, i.e. containing d-allo-Ile and d-allo-Thr along with d-amino acids and glycine. To understand its apparent biological activity, we set out to chemically synthesize d-allo-ShK and determine its X-ray structure by racemic crystallography. Using validated allo-Thr and allo-Ile, both l-allo-ShK and d-allo-ShK polypeptide chains were prepared by total chemical synthesis. Neither the l-allo-ShK nor the d-allo-ShK polypeptides folded, whereas both l-ShK and d-ShK folded smoothly under the same conditions. Re-examination of NMR spectra of the previously reported d-allo-ShK protein revealed that diagnostic Thr and Ile signals were the same as for authentic d-ShK. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the previously reported d-allo-ShK was in fact d-ShK, the true enantiomer of natural l-ShK toxin, and that the apparent biological activity may have arisen from inadvertent contamination with trace amounts of l-ShK toxin.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title: \"Mapping of voltage sensor positions in resting and inactivated mammalian sodium channels by LRET.\",\r\n        description: \"T.

Although vertebrate Nav function has been extensively studied, the detailed structural basis for voltage-dependent gating mechanisms remain obscure. We have assessed the structural changes of the Nav voltage sensor domain using lanthanide-based resonance energy transfer (LRET) between the rat skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav1.4) and fluorescently labeled Nav1.4-targeting toxins. We generated donor constructs with genetically encoded lanthanide-binding tags (LBTs) inserted at the extracellular end of the S4 segment of each domain (with a single LBT per construct). Three different Bodipy-labeled, Nav1.4-targeting toxins were synthesized as acceptors: β-scorpion toxin (Ts1)-Bodipy, KIIIA-Bodipy, and GIIIA-Bodipy analogs. Functional Nav-LBT channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes were voltage-clamped, and distinct LRET signals were obtained in the resting and slow inactivated states. Intramolecular distances computed from the LRET signals define a geometrical map of Nav1.4 with the bound toxins, and reveal voltage-dependent structural changes related to channel gating.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title: \"Elucidation of the Covalent and Tertiary Structures of Biologically Active Ts3 Toxin.\",\r\n        description: \"B.

Here we show that gold nanoparticles can be conjugated to high-avidity ligands for a variety of cellular targets. Once bound to a neuron, these particles transduce millisecond pulses of light into heat, which changes membrane capacitance, depolarizing the cell and eliciting action potentials. Compared to non-functionalized nanoparticles, ligand-conjugated nanoparticles highly resist convective washout and enable photothermal stimulation with lower delivered energy and resulting temperature increase. Ligands targeting three different membrane proteins were tested; all showed similar activity and washout resistance. This suggests that many types of ligands can be bound to nanoparticles, preserving ligand and nanoparticle function, and that many different cell phenotypes can be targeted by appropriate choice of ligand. The findings have applications as an alternative to optogenetics and potentially for therapies involving neuronal photostimulation.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title: \"Total Chemical Synthesis of Biologically Active Fluorescent Dye-Labeled Ts1 Toxin.\",\r\n        description: \"B.

Total synthesis combined with click chemistry was used to label the Ts1 protein molecule with the fluorescent dyes Alexa-Fluor 488 and Bodipy. Dye-labeled Ts1 proteins retained their optical properties and bound to and modified the voltage dependence of the sodium channel Nav. Because of the highly specific binding of Ts1 toxin to Nav, successful chemical synthesis and labeling of Ts1 toxin provides an important tool for biophysical studies, histochemical studies, and opto-pharmacological studies of the Nav protein.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        title: \"Native Chemical Ligation at Asx-Cys, Glx-Cys: Chemical Synthesis and High-Resolution X-ray Structure of ShK Toxin by Racemic Protein Crystallography.\",\r\n        description: \"B.

Using the improved thioaryl catalyst 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (MPAA), native chemical ligation could be performed at -Gln-Cys- and Asn-Cys- sites without side reactions. After optimization, ligation at a -Glu-Cys- site could also be used as a ligation site, with minimal levels of byproduct formation. However, -Asp-Cys- is not appropriate for use as a site for native chemical ligation because of formation of significant amounts of β-linked byproduct. The feasibility of native chemical ligation at -Gln-Cys- enabled a convergent total chemical synthesis of the enantiomeric forms of the ShK toxin protein molecule. The D-ShK protein molecule was ~50,000-fold less active in blocking the Kv1.3 channel than the L-ShK protein molecule. Racemic protein crystallography was used to obtain high-resolution X-ray diffraction data for ShK toxin.
